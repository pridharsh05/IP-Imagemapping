 It is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, 
 and often various other ingredients
(such as various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high 
temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

Baking<br>

In restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, 
a conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. 
The pizza is slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the oven surface is. 
Before use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it.
 When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. 
 Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.
 Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. 
 As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries,[43] in order to achieve even heat distribution.
  Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.

Most restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their pizzas. Mass production of pizza by chains can be completely automated.
