Popcorn (also called popped corn, popcorns or pop-corn) is a variety of corn kernel which expands and puffs up when heated; the same names also refer to the foodstuff produced by the expansion.

A popcorn kernel's strong hull contains the seed's hard, starchy shell endosperm with 14â€“20% moisture, 
which turns to steam as the kernel is heated. 
Pressure from the steam continues to build until the hull ruptures, allowing the kernel to forcefully expand, 
to 20 to 50 times its original size, and then cool
