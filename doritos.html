Doritos is an American brand of flavored tortilla chips produced since 1964 by Frito-Lay, a wholly owned subsidiary of PepsiCo.
The original Doritos were not flavored. 
The first flavor was Toasted Corn, released in 1966, followed by Taco in 1967 and Nacho Cheese in 1972.
Other specialty flavors began to make their debut during the late 1980s. 
The concept for Doritos originated in a restaurant at Disneyland.

Doritos has also gained notability for its marketing campaigns, including many ads aired during the Super Bowl.
The term dorito is a contraction of Spanish doradito (little fried and golden thing), which is a diminutive of dorado (fried and golden thing).

The original product was made at the Casa de Fritos (now Rancho Del Zocalo) at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, during the early 1960s. Using surplus tortillas and taking the original idea from the traditional Mexican snack known as totopo, the company-owned restaurant cut them up, fried them, and added basic seasoning, resembling the Mexican chilaquiles, but in this case being dry. Arch West was the vice president of marketing of Frito-Lay at the time, and noticed their popularity. He made a deal in 1964 with Alex Foods, the provider of many items for Casa de Fritos at Disneyland, and produced the chips for a short time regionally, before it was overwhelmed by the volume, and Frito-Lay moved the production in-house to its Tulsa plant.[6][7]

Doritos were released nationwide in 1966, the first tortilla chip to be launched nationally in the United States.
