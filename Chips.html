A potato chip (North American English and Australian English; often just chip) or crisp (British and Irish English) is a thin slice of potato that has been deep fried, baked, or air fried until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured
 using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavors, and additives.

 In Japan, flavors include norishio (nori and salt), consomm√©, wasabi, soy sauce and butter, garlic, plum, barbecue, pizza, mayonnaise, 
 and black pepper. Chili, scallop with butter, teriyaki, takoyaki, and yakitori chip flavors are also available. 
 Major manufacturers include Calbee[61] and Koikeya.
 In Hong Kong, the two prominent potato chips are the spicy "Ethnican" variety by Calbee, and barbecue by Jack 'n Jill.

In Indonesia, potato chips are commonly called kripik kentang and traditionally fell under the kripik category. The major brands are Indofood's Chitato (since 1990s)[64] and Lay's (Frito-Lay). In 2014, Japan's Calbee and Indonesia's Wings Food formed Calbeewings, a joint venture and marketed Potabee potato chips offering two flavors: beef BBQ and grilled seaweed.[65] Lay's potato chips sold in Indonesia are available in six flavors: honey butter, sour cream and onion, nori seaweed, beef barbecue, classic salty, and salmon teriyaki flavors.[66] In 2018 Chitato launched three unusual flavors: beef rendang, 
fried crab golden egg yolk, and mango sticky rice.[6
