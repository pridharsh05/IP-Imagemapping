Ketchup or catsup is a table condiment with a sweet and sour flavor. 
The unmodified term ("ketchup") now typically refers to tomato ketchup,
 although early recipes used egg whites, mushrooms, oysters, grapes, mussels, or walnuts, among other ingredients.
<br>
Tomato ketchup is made from tomatoes, sugar, and vinegar, with seasonings and spices. The spices and flavors vary, 
but commonly include onions, allspice, coriander, cloves, cumin, garlic, and mustard, and sometimes include celery, cinnamon, or ginger.
[citation needed] The market leader in the United States (60% market share) and the United Kingdom (82%) is Heinz Tomato Ketchup.<br>

 Tomato ketchup is often used as a condiment to dishes that are usually served hot and are fried or greasy: <br>
 french fries and other potato dishes, hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken tenders, hot sandwiches, meat pies, cooked eggs, 
 and grilled or fried meat. Ketchup is sometimes used as the basis for, or as one ingredient in, other sauces and dressings, 
 and the flavor may be replicated as an additive flavoring for snacks, such as potato chips.
